# Swift-data-structure-and-algorithms
Here let's find some of the most popular algorithms and data structures in Swift, I'll try to explain how they work. Also, I find it important to write down and keep what I have learned so they will stay organized whenever I need to look up. 

## 1. Big O Notation
According to Wiki, big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Ohh...
Ok, it's just a way to describe the time and space complexity of a function or an algorithm you wrote, i.e., how the function will behave when input is very large. For example, if you want to sort an array of numbers, bubble sort will result in O(n^2) time complexity and merge sort will give you O(n*logn) time complexity, which is much better.

**2. Primitives
